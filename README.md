# Maternity FHIR user cases
Maternity FHIR message for use case in NHS Hackathon June 2021

Just an initial block of stub code to load up some example maternity message into FHIR bundles and return them as JSON.

The intention is to construct these messages from background maternity systems and then load them into kafka queues.
